  <h1 style="text-align:left;">Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>OnlinePay Inc. takes privacy and data protection issues very seriously.  OnlinePay Inc.' Privacy Policy applies to personal information  collected from merchants who contract with OnlinePay Inc. to use our  services, as well as consumer information that OnlinePay Inc. may acquire in the course of our business. </p>
  <p>As OnlinePay Inc.' services change, we may revise this policy. If you  have questions about OnlinePay Inc.' privacy practices please contact  us at <a href="mailto:d.cash@onlinepay.com">d.cash@onlinepay.com</a>.</p>
  <h2>Information  Collected</h2>
  <p>OnlinePay Inc. collects information from its merchants through an  application process used to establish an account to utilize our  services.  OnlinePay Inc. does not obtain information from individuals or  companies via our Web site.  We only obtain information from when an  individual or company applies for an account to use our services.  At  that time, we will ask for contact information (such as your name,  street address, phone, fax and e-mail address), and information  pertaining to your business, including but not limited to current  financial statements, bank account and/or settlement account  information, and how you will utilize OnlinePay Inc.' services.  Additionally, to process individual transactions for merchants, we  typically will receive from the merchant information related to the  specific transaction. This might include information about the  transaction that a consumer has furnished the merchant in placing the  order for example. Any personal information we might receive in  processing transactions varies according to the nature of the  transaction and the way in which merchants are using our services. It  generally will include customer information, banking information and  transaction information.  Personal consumer information is used to  process payment transactions and for no other purpose. </p>
  <h2>Information  Disclosure</h2>
  <p>Protecting personal information about merchants and consumers is  an important part of our business. Personal information is shared  with third party banks to the extent necessary for OnlinePay Inc. to  complete the e-check transaction. We also may release personal  information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law  or verify information with other companies for fraud protection and  risk reduction. </p>
  <h2>Information  Security</h2>
  <p>Information security is critical to our business. We work to  protect the security of consumers' information as well as our  merchants through the use of security and encryption software.  Any  information that is gathered, rather than merely passed through as  part of a transaction, is stored on servers located in a secure data  center. The number of people with access to these servers is very  limited. Firewalls and other security technology are used to prevent  system servers and computers from being accessed by unauthorized  persons. It is the merchant's responsibility to protect against  unauthorized access to the system through misuse of individual  Merchant ID, User Name and Password.  To assure of no unauthorized  access, please be certain you log off the system when finished with  your session and protect your Merchant ID, User Name and Password  used to access your merchant account. </p>
  <h2>System  Access</h2>
  <p>OnlinePay Inc. gives merchants' authorized personnel the ability to  set system access and user permissions on an individual basis,  including system view and administrative settings. </p>
  <h2>Contacting OnlinePay Inc.</h2>
